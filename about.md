### About us
The *Intelligent System Security (IS2) Lab* is a research group led by [Prof. Jingyi Wang](wang-jingyi.github.io) affiliated with the College of Control Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China. We mainly conduct research in the interdisciplinary fields of formal methods, software engineering, system security and machine learning, with a focus on providing reliability or security guarantees for practical large-scale Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems and Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) like autonomous driving cars, industrial control systems, recommendation systems, healthcare, etc.

### Vacencies
We are actively looking for self-motivated PostDoc/PhD/master/research assistants/research interns with competitive packages to join my group at ZJU.
Feel free to drop me an email with CV if you are interested in any of the above research topics. Preferred PhD candidates should either be good at programming or maths, and more importantly love doing research. For ZJU students, kindly check out my Google Calendar if you wish to have a talk.
